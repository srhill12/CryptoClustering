# CryptoClustering

## Purpose
In this project I aim to apply my understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

I look to identify optimal k values and compare k values from scaled data and PCA data. I will also answer questions such as, "What is the total explained variance of the principal components?" and "Which features have the strongest positive or negative influence on each component?".

## Resources
Various exercises from Module 11 were used as inspiration, mainly PCA Example and Segmenting with PCA.
